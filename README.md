Arena Eats is a React Native app that was born during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this COVID hit world, all forms of social gatherings and events are off. Arenas that would have hosted sports, theater and other gatherings are yearning to be filled with people right now. The owners are also taking financial hits.

Our app would provide some sort of relief once people are allowed back into arenas, albeit in limited numbers. Initially some sort of social distancing would still be wanted in the small number of spectators that are allowed back into the arenas. This would involve screening and proper arrival and exit times for individuals amongst other things.
These all practices however will go to waste if we cannot ensure that during the event, people don't move inside for reasons like getting food, drinks etc.

To solve this issue, we present Arena Eats, an app that lets you browse throught the wide variety of restaruants, bars etc. within or near the Arenas so that you can get your desired food while also making sure you're following some sort of Social distancing. Our app will allow users to have food delievered right to their seats so that they don't miss out on important plays, scenes or any other thing.
